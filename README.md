# Project Name

The project's aim was to build an order form, in this case for ordering either pizza, pasta or salad.

## The problem

In this project we focused mainly on vanilla-js, HTML and CSS. This was the first real project we did during the bootcamp and it was a struggle back then to connect the pages together and getting the prompts right.

This project is an easy start for people who wants to learn the basics. It's clean cut and no installations are needed.
